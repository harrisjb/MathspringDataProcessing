# MathspringDataProcessing
A collection of scripts for processing [Mathspring](https://github.com/marshall62/mathspring) data. This is intended as a starting point for anyone who wants to work with Mathspring's data.

To get it running, all you should need to do is:
- Have Python installed
- Clone the repository
- Get the necessary modules (such as with "pip install -r requirements.txt")
- Run one of the data processing scripts ("python dec2016-empathy.py")

Note that the database structure changes so the most recent script is most likely to reflect that and run properly.

Script List- <br>
1. dec2016-empathy.py - Extracts event log for the specified date intervals and class IDs. Refer to the comments in the script for inputs.
